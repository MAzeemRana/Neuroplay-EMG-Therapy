**NeuroPlay – AI-Driven EMG Gaming for Therapy** 
It is an innovative project that integrates AI-Model , EMG signals, and gaming for physical rehabilitation. Using a MyoWare EMG sensor, the system captures muscle activity from the biceps and triceps, processes it through a Python-based AI model, and classifies different muscle movements in real time.
The classified signals are then transmitted to an Arduino, which controls a Unity-based game, allowing users to interact and play using only their muscle movements. This hands-free approach demonstrates the power of AI in assistive technology, promoting both rehabilitation and accessibility through engaging, interactive gameplay.
